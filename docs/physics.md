## What is water?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water) it's consists of
two `H` (Hydrogen) and one `O` (Oxygen) atom.

The hydrogen atoms donate their electron to the oxygen atom such that water
molecules have a polarity, at least partially. Hence, we a positive charge at
the Hydrogen atoms and negative charge on the oxygen atom. The reason for that
is that oxygen is more *electronegative* (TODO: Explain why?). 

> We will assume a point-charge model of the water molecule with 2 positive
charges and one negative charge.
